Hi Paul,
I just want to make sure we don’t have any confusion regarding how everything is submitted.  I think it is helpful to have what you have written about submitting required documents to P.O. Box in bold letters and in plain sight.  I do think we should make it clear to submit the scholarships online however.  So could we do something like this:  Scholarship applications should be submitted online.  ALL required supplemental documentation, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, IEPs, etc. MUST be submitted to P.O.Box 1032, Huntington, IN  46750.  

Also, two quick (I hope) corrections…on each of the scholarship descriptions where it asks for a letter, can you change an to a?  It says “an college professor” and “an high school teacher.”  Also, for the John Decker, can you add college professor?   “A high school teacher, college professor or employer.”

Thank you Paul. Let me know when the changes are made and I will take another look. 
Paula
